## ComputerGraphicsProjects
A collection of projects exploring Java2D, Java3D, and OpenGL

## Project 1
  A simple GUI application using java AWT and SWING to move a graphical object around the screen and
  change its color. Control the shapes location via mouse click, or arrow keys. Change its 
  color via the radio buttons on the right hand side of the window. 


## Project 2
  An exploration of constructive geometry (via yin-yang graphic) and 
  the capabilities of the Path2D object in java (via spirograph graphic)


## Project 3
  An interactive GUI for using Java's AffineTransform in order to manipulate 
  the transformations of a graphic object.


## Project 4
  A Java program with a text field, a button, and a text area. 
  A user may enter a string in the text field and when the button “Print” is clicked, 
  the text area will display the pattern of the string formed with asterisks. 
  The same pattern will also be printed to the console.


## Project 5 - Cellular Automata
 An implementation of a cellular automaton with the following rules based on the four-neighbor of a cell: 
  1. A white cell becomes black if the number of its black neighbors is not 1; 
  2. A black cell stays black if the number of its black neighbors is either 1 or 3; 
  3. Otherwise, the cell becomes white.
