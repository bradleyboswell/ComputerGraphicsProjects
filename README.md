## Project 3

## Project 4
  A Java program with a text field, a button, and a text area. 
  A user may enter a string in the text field and when the button “Print” is clicked, 
  the text area will display the pattern of the string formed with asterisks. 
  The same pattern will also be printed to the console.


## Project 5 - Cellular Automata
 An implementation of a cellular automaton with the following rules based on the four-neighbor of a cell: 
  1. A white cell becomes black if the number of its black neighbors is not 1; 
  2. A black cell stays black if the number of its black neighbors is either 1 or 3; 
  3. Otherwise, the cell becomes white.
